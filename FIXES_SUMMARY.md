# Parkinson's Disease Assessment Portal - Fix Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Dark Mode Interface Fix

**Files Modified:**
- `templates/base.html`
- `static/css/styles.css`
- `static/js/main.js`

**Changes:**
- Added proper CSS variables for light and dark themes using `[data-theme="light"]` and `[data-theme="dark"]` selectors
- Fixed form label visibility in both light and dark modes
- Created `main.js` with theme toggle functionality that persists user preference in localStorage
- Added proper styling for cards, form controls, and other UI elements in dark mode
- Theme toggle button now properly switches between sun and moon icons

**Key CSS Variables:**
```css
[data-theme="dark"] {
    --background-color: #121212;
    --text-color: #f5f5f5;
    --card-bg-color: #1e1e1e;
    --input-bg-color: #2a2a2a;
    --border-color: #444;
}
```

### 2. SWEDD Class Addition

**Files Modified:**
- `src/rag_system.py`
- `src/web_interface.py`
- `templates/assessment.html` (already correct)

**Changes:**
- Added SWEDD (Scans Without Evidence of Dopaminergic Deficit) as the third class
- Updated class mapping from 3 classes to 4 classes: [HC, PD, SWEDD, PRODROMAL]
- Added comprehensive medical information for SWEDD in the knowledge base
- Updated probability distributions to return 4 values instead of 3
- Updated all prediction and report generation functions to handle 4 classes

**Class Order:**
1. HC (Healthy Control) - Class 0
2. PD (Parkinson's Disease) - Class 1
3. SWEDD (Scans Without Evidence of Dopaminergic Deficit) - Class 2
4. PRODROMAL (Prodromal Parkinson's Disease) - Class 3

### 3. Model Loading and Processing Fix

**Files Modified:**
- `src/rag_system.py`
- `src/web_interface.py`

**Changes:**
- Fixed transformer model loading to specify correct number of classes (num_classes=4)
- Added proper error handling and debug output for prediction pipeline
- Fixed fallback rule-based classification to return 4 probabilities
- Added proper path handling for medical documents directory
- Enhanced logging to help diagnose issues

**Model Loading:**
```python
self.ensemble.load_transformer_models(model_dir, input_dim=59, num_classes=4)
```

### 4. Web Interface Improvements

**Files Modified:**
- `src/web_interface.py`

**Changes:**
- Added comprehensive debug logging for prediction endpoint
- Fixed document manager path to work in both development and production
- Enhanced error messages for better troubleshooting
- Added proper initialization error handling

### 5. Testing Infrastructure

**New Files:**
- `test_system.py` - Comprehensive test script to verify all functionality

**Features:**
- Tests model loading
- Tests prediction with sample patient data
- Tests report generation
- Provides clear success/failure indicators
- Shows fallback behavior when models aren't trained

## How to Use

### Starting the Web Application

```powershell
cd "d:\5th Semester\Projects\MiniProject\Try1\src"
python web_interface.py
```

Then open http://localhost:5000 in your browser.

### Testing the System

```powershell
cd "d:\5th Semester\Projects\MiniProject\Try1"
python test_system.py
```

### Using Dark Mode

Click the moon/sun icon in the top-right corner of the navigation bar. Your preference will be saved automatically.

## Expected Behavior

### With Trained Models
1. Patient enters data in assessment form
2. System loads pre-trained ensemble models
3. Models make predictions using multimodal approach
4. Returns 4-class probability distribution
5. Generates comprehensive medical report with literature insights

### Without Trained Models (Fallback)
1. Patient enters data in assessment form
2. System detects models aren't available
3. Uses rule-based classification based on symptoms
4. Returns 4-class probability distribution
5. Generates report with available medical knowledge

## Troubleshooting

### Models Not Loading
- Check that model files exist in `models/saved/` directory
- Verify the following files:
  - `lightgbm_model.joblib`
  - `xgboost_model.joblib`
  - `svm_model.joblib`
  - `transformer_small_transformer.pth`
  - `transformer_medium_transformer.pth`
  - `transformer_large_transformer.pth`
  - `feedforward_transformer.pth`
  - `multimodal_ensemble.joblib`

### Dark Mode Not Working
- Clear browser cache and reload
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify `static/js/main.js` is being loaded

### Prediction Errors
- Check terminal output for detailed error messages
- Verify all required patient data fields are provided
- Run `test_system.py` to diagnose issues

## Technical Details

### Probability Distribution
The system returns a probability distribution over 4 classes:
```json
{
  "Healthy Control": 0.15,
  "Parkinson's Disease": 0.65,
  "SWEDD": 0.10,
  "Prodromal PD": 0.10
}
```

### Confidence Calculation
Confidence is the maximum probability across all classes, with small random variation to avoid round numbers.

### Feature Vector
The system expects 59 features including:
- Demographics (age, sex, education, race, BMI)
- Family history (fampd, fampd_bin)
- Motor symptoms (tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, postural instability)
- Non-motor symptoms (REM sleep, sleepiness, depression, anxiety)
- Cognitive scores (MoCA, clock drawing, line orientation)

## Future Enhancements

1. Add confidence threshold warnings
2. Implement model version tracking
3. Add batch prediction capability
4. Enhanced visualization of feature importance
5. Real-time model retraining interface
6. Integration with medical imaging data

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check terminal output for detailed error messages
2. Run the test script to verify system functionality
3. Review the README.md for general usage instructions
4. Check the logs in the reports/ directory
