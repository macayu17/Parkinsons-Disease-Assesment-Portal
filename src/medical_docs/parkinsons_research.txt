Abstract:
This paper reviews recent advances in Parkinson's Disease (PD) research, focusing on early detection, biomarkers, and treatment options.

Key Findings:
1. Early Detection: Tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability remain the cardinal symptoms of PD. However, non-motor symptoms like REM sleep behavior disorder, hyposmia, and constipation often precede motor symptoms by years and may serve as early indicators.

2. Biomarkers: Alpha-synuclein aggregation in peripheral tissues shows promise as a biomarker. Neuroimaging techniques including DaTscan can help differentiate PD from other movement disorders.

3. Genetic Factors: Mutations in LRRK2, GBA, and SNCA genes are associated with increased PD risk. Family history remains a significant risk factor, with first-degree relatives having 2-3 times higher risk.

4. Treatment Approaches: Levodopa remains the gold standard for symptomatic treatment. Deep brain stimulation shows efficacy for motor symptoms in advanced cases. Emerging therapies targeting alpha-synuclein are in clinical trials.

5. Differential Diagnosis: SWEDD (Scans Without Evidence of Dopaminergic Deficit) patients present with parkinsonian symptoms but normal dopaminergic imaging. Essential tremor differs from PD tremor by being primarily postural rather than resting.

Conclusion:
Early diagnosis and personalized treatment approaches based on symptom profile, genetic factors, and biomarkers represent the future of PD management. Multidisciplinary care remains essential for optimal patient outcomes.
