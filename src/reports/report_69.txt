PARKINSON'S DISEASE ASSESSMENT REPORT
=====================================
Patient ID: 69
Report Date: 2025-10-05 17:47:36
Generated by: AI-Powered Multimodal ML System

CLINICAL ASSESSMENT SUMMARY
===========================

PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: Prodromal Parkinson's Disease
Confidence Level: 40.0%

DIAGNOSTIC PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION:
- Healthy Control: 20.0%
- Parkinson's Disease: 30.0%
- SWEDD: 10.0%
- Prodromal PD: 40.0%

CLINICAL DESCRIPTION:
Early stage with subtle symptoms that may precede clinical PD

KEY CHARACTERISTICS OBSERVED:
• Subtle motor signs
• REM sleep behavior disorder
• Hyposmia (reduced sense of smell)
• Mild cognitive changes
• Possible depression or anxiety

2. From '': Parkinson’s disease (PD), as with all neurodegenera-
tive diseases, does not start suddenly. This implies that
the disease progresses through early phases, during
which neurodegeneration has commenced but has not
yet progressed to the point at which PD can be deﬁni-
tively diagnosed. The early phase...

3. From '': Methodology of Criteria Design
The primary methodology for sequentially adding
diagnostic information is termed the na €ıve Bayesian clas-
siﬁer. This methodology takes a baseline pretest (i.e.,“prior”) probability of disease, then adds the results of a
new diagnostic test to arrive at a new (post-t...


FEATURE ANALYSIS:
==================================================
• Age (22 years): Patient age is a significant risk factor for Parkinson's disease. Risk level: Low
• SEX: 0 - Gender differences exist in PD prevalence and presentation
• BMI: 21 - Body mass index can affect disease progression
• Family History: Positive for Parkinson's disease
• SYM_TREMOR: 2 - Tremor severity assessment
• SYM_RIGID: 2 - Muscle rigidity evaluation

CLINICAL RECOMMENDATIONS:
==================================================
1. Close monitoring for symptom progression
2. Lifestyle modifications (exercise, diet)
3. Sleep study if REM sleep disorder suspected
4. Cognitive assessment
5. Consider neuroprotective strategies

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:
• Genetic counseling: Consider due to positive family history

MODEL CONSENSUS ANALYSIS:
==================================================
• STRONG CONSENSUS: All models agree on the diagnosis

Individual Model Predictions:
• XGBOOST: PRODROMAL
• LIGHTGBM: PRODROMAL
• SVM: PRODROMAL
• TRANSFORMER_SMALL: PRODROMAL
• TRANSFORMER_MEDIUM: PRODROMAL
