CLINICAL ASSESSMENT SUMMARY
===========================

PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: Parkinson's Disease
Confidence Level: 70.00%

DIAGNOSTIC PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION:
- Healthy Control: 10.00%
- Parkinson's Disease: 70.00%
- SWEDD: 10.00%
- Prodromal PD: 10.00%

CLINICAL DESCRIPTION:
Diagnosed with Parkinson's disease showing characteristic motor symptoms

KEY CHARACTERISTICS OBSERVED:
• Presence of bradykinesia (slowness of movement)
• Resting tremor
• Muscle rigidity
• Postural instability
• Possible non-motor symptoms

balances sensitivity and speciﬁcity). The Movement Dis-
order Society criteria retain elements proven valuable inprevious criteria and omit aspects that are no longerjustiﬁed, thereby encapsulating diagnosis according to
current knowledge. As understanding of PD expands,
the Movement Disorder Society criteria will need contin-uous revision to ...

3. From '': parkinsonian disorder (essential tremor, dystonic
tremor, and so forth). The MDS-PD Criteria are
designed to minimize both of these diagnostic errors.
Of note, studies have suggested that experienced
clinicians can diagnose PD with greater accuracy than
formal diagnostic criteria.9Therefore, until deﬁnitive
validated diagnostic markers are available, clinical
expert opinion will be the gold standa...

4. From '': least 60 partici pants (including /C2130 patients with
non-PD parkinsonism) must have documented 80%or more speciﬁcity. A publis hed meta-analysis com-
bining studies with smaller numbers of patients could
substitute for one qualifyi ng study (two other studies
with>30 patients in each group are still required).

5. From '': TABLE 1. MDS Clinical Diagnostic Criteria for PD—Executive Summary/Completion Form
The ﬁrst essential criterion is parkinsonism, which is deﬁned as bradykinesia, in combination with at least 1 of rest tremor or rigidity. Examination of all car-
dinal manifestations should be carried out as described in the MDS–Uniﬁed Parkinson Disease Rating Scale.30Once parkinsonism has been diagnosed:

FEATURE ANALYSIS:
==================================================
• Age (56 years): Risk level: Moderate
• Gender: Male - Gender differences exist in PD prevalence and presentation
• Education Years: 12 - Education level may influence cognitive reserve
• Body Mass Index: 24 - Body mass index can affect disease progression
• Family History: Negative for Parkinson's disease
• Tremor Severity: Very Severe - Tremor severity assessment
• Rigidity: Severe - Muscle rigidity evaluation
• Bradykinesia: Moderate - Bradykinesia (slowness of movement) assessment
• Postural Instability: Severe - Postural instability evaluation
• Depression Score: 8 - Depression indicated - Geriatric Depression Scale score
• Anxiety Score: 30 - Normal - State-Trait Anxiety Inventory score
• Sleepiness Scale: 0 - Epworth Sleepiness Scale score
• REM Sleep Behavior: 0 - REM sleep behavior disorder assessment

CLINICAL RECOMMENDATIONS:
==================================================
1. Regular neurological follow-up
2. Consider dopaminergic medication
3. Physical therapy and exercise
4. Speech therapy if needed
5. Monitor for medication side effects

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:
• Depression management: Consider psychiatric evaluation and treatment

MODEL CONSENSUS ANALYSIS:
==================================================
• STRONG CONSENSUS: All models agree on the diagnosis

Individual Model Predictions:
• XGBOOST: PD
• LIGHTGBM: PD
• SVM: PD
• TRANSFORMER_SMALL: PD
• TRANSFORMER_MEDIUM: PD
