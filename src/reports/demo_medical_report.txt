PARKINSON'S DISEASE ASSESSMENT REPORT
=====================================
Patient ID: DEMO_PATIENT_001
Report Date: 2025-10-05 10:01:53
Generated by: AI-Powered Multimodal ML System

CLINICAL ASSESSMENT SUMMARY
===========================

PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: Parkinson's Disease
Confidence Level: 70.0%

DIAGNOSTIC PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION:
- Healthy Control: 10.0%
- Parkinson's Disease: 70.0%
- SWEDD: 10.0%
- Prodromal PD: 10.0%

CLINICAL DESCRIPTION:
Diagnosed with Parkinson's disease showing characteristic motor symptoms

KEY CHARACTERISTICS OBSERVED:
• Presence of bradykinesia (slowness of movement)
• Resting tremor
• Muscle rigidity
• Postural instability
• Possible non-motor symptoms

FEATURE ANALYSIS:
==================================================
• Age (65 years): Patient age is a significant risk factor for Parkinson's disease. Risk level: High
• SEX: 1 - Gender differences exist in PD prevalence and presentation
• BMI: 26.5 - Body mass index can affect disease progression
• Family History: Positive for Parkinson's disease
• MoCA Score (24): Montreal Cognitive Assessment score. Status: Mild impairment
• SYM_TREMOR: 2 - Tremor severity assessment
• SYM_RIGID: 1 - Muscle rigidity evaluation

CLINICAL RECOMMENDATIONS:
==================================================
1. Regular neurological follow-up
2. Consider dopaminergic medication
3. Physical therapy and exercise
4. Speech therapy if needed
5. Monitor for medication side effects

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:
• Age-related monitoring: Increased surveillance due to advanced age
• Genetic counseling: Consider due to positive family history
• Cognitive assessment: Follow-up neuropsychological testing recommended

MODEL CONSENSUS ANALYSIS:
==================================================
• STRONG CONSENSUS: All models agree on the diagnosis

Individual Model Predictions:
• XGBOOST: PD
• LIGHTGBM: PD
• SVM: PD
• TRANSFORMER_SMALL: PD
• TRANSFORMER_MEDIUM: PD
