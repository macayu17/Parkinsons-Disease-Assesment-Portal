PARKINSON'S DISEASE ASSESSMENT REPORT
=====================================
Patient ID: 1704
Report Date: 2025-10-08 15:32:41
Generated by: AI-Powered Multimodal ML System

CLINICAL ASSESSMENT SUMMARY
===========================

PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS: Prodromal Parkinson's Disease
Confidence Level: 40.00%

DIAGNOSTIC PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION:
- Healthy Control: 20.00%
- Parkinson's Disease: 30.00%
- SWEDD: 10.00%
- Prodromal PD: 40.00%

CLINICAL DESCRIPTION:
Early stage with subtle symptoms that may precede clinical PD

KEY CHARACTERISTICS OBSERVED:
• Subtle motor signs
• REM sleep behavior disorder
• Hyposmia (reduced sense of smell)
• Mild cognitive changes
• Possible depression or anxiety

2. From '': Parkinson’s disease (PD), as with all neurodegenera-
tive diseases, does not start suddenly. This implies that
the disease progresses through early phases, during
which neurodegeneration has commenced but has not
yet progressed to the point at which PD can be deﬁni-
tively diagnosed. The early phase of PD has both
motor and nonmotor aspects, and in many cases, cer-
tain nonmotor abnormalities are ...

3. From '': Methodology of Criteria Design
The primary methodology for sequentially adding
diagnostic information is termed the na €ıve Bayesian clas-
siﬁer. This methodology takes a baseline pretest (i.e.,“prior”) probability of disease, then adds the results of a
new diagnostic test to arrive at a new (post-test) proba-
bility of disease. Results of additional diagnostic testscan then be sequentially added,...

4. From '': Calculation of each LR is based upon the relative risk
a sw e l la st h ep r e v a l e n c eo ft h er i s kf a c t o r( L R sa r ec a l -culated independent of the disease prevalence). A priorprobability (i.e., estimated prodromal PD prevalence) of
2% is used for calculations. An example is provided for
caffeine, assuming relative risk (RR) 51.5 for nonuse
of caffeine, with 25% of the population h...

- never smoker (40% prevalence)

- former smoker (minimum 1 pack-year) RR 50.75

6. Genetics: For this analysis, one can use either a pos-
itive family history of PD or results from a known
genetic mutation. Because these are not independent
variables, both cannot be used for the same patient.

FEATURE ANALYSIS:
==================================================
• Age (55 years): Risk level: Moderate
• Gender: Male - Gender differences exist in PD prevalence and presentation
• Education Years: 16 - Education level may influence cognitive reserve
• Body Mass Index: 23 - Body mass index can affect disease progression
• Family History: Negative for Parkinson's disease
• Tremor Severity: Mild - Tremor severity assessment
• Rigidity: Severe - Muscle rigidity evaluation
• Bradykinesia: Severe - Bradykinesia (slowness of movement) assessment
• Postural Instability: Mild - Postural instability evaluation
• MoCA Score (0/30): Status: Significant impairment
• Depression Score: 4 - Normal - Geriatric Depression Scale score
• Anxiety Score: 35 - Normal - State-Trait Anxiety Inventory score
• Sleepiness Scale: 16 - Epworth Sleepiness Scale score
• REM Sleep Behavior: 1 - REM sleep behavior disorder assessment

CLINICAL RECOMMENDATIONS:
==================================================
1. Close monitoring for symptom progression
2. Lifestyle modifications (exercise, diet)
3. Sleep study if REM sleep disorder suspected
4. Cognitive assessment
5. Consider neuroprotective strategies

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:
• Cognitive assessment: Follow-up neuropsychological testing recommended
• Sleep evaluation: Consider sleep study for excessive daytime sleepiness
• REM sleep behavior disorder: Consider polysomnography and treatment

MODEL CONSENSUS ANALYSIS:
==================================================
• STRONG CONSENSUS: All models agree on the diagnosis

Individual Model Predictions:
• XGBOOST: PRODROMAL
• LIGHTGBM: PRODROMAL
• SVM: PRODROMAL
• TRANSFORMER_SMALL: PRODROMAL
• TRANSFORMER_MEDIUM: PRODROMAL
• TRANSFORMER_LARGE: PRODROMAL
