Abstract:
This paper discusses the differential diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease (PD) and other parkinsonian syndromes, providing clinical guidelines for accurate diagnosis.

Key Points:
1. Parkinson's Disease vs. Essential Tremor:
   - PD tremor: Typically resting, asymmetric, 4-6 Hz frequency
   - Essential tremor: Primarily postural/action tremor, often symmetric, 8-12 Hz frequency
   - Essential tremor patients typically lack bradykinesia and rigidity
   - Family history more common in essential tremor

2. Parkinson's Disease vs. SWEDD:
   - SWEDD (Scans Without Evidence of Dopaminergic Deficit) patients present with parkinsonian symptoms
   - Normal dopaminergic imaging distinguishes SWEDD from PD
   - SWEDD patients often show dystonic features and lack true bradykinesia
   - SWEDD patients typically do not respond well to levodopa therapy

3. Parkinson's Disease vs. Atypical Parkinsonism:
   - Multiple System Atrophy (MSA): Early autonomic failure, cerebellar signs, poor levodopa response
   - Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP): Early falls, vertical gaze palsy, axial rigidity
   - Corticobasal Degeneration (CBD): Asymmetric apraxia, alien limb phenomenon, cortical sensory loss

4. Prodromal Parkinson's Disease:
   - REM sleep behavior disorder: 80% convert to synucleinopathy within 10-15 years
   - Hyposmia: Reduced sense of smell often precedes motor symptoms by years
   - Constipation: Common non-motor symptom that may appear decades before diagnosis
   - Subtle motor changes: Reduced arm swing, changes in handwriting, voice softening

Conclusion:
Accurate differential diagnosis requires careful clinical assessment, consideration of response to levodopa, neuroimaging, and monitoring of disease progression. Early non-motor symptoms may help identify prodromal PD cases before classic motor features emerge.
